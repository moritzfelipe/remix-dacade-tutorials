# 2. Basic Syntax
In this section we will create our first *smart contract*. This contract consists of a string that holds the value "Hello World!".

In the first line, we should specify the license the contract uses. You can find a comprehensive list of licenses here: https://spdx.org/licenses/.

Using the `pragma` keyword, we specify the solidity version that you want the compiler to use. In this case, it should be greater than or equal to `0.8.3` but less than 0.9.0.

We define a contract with the keyword `contract` and give it a name, in this case `HelloWorld`.

Inside our contract we define a *state variable* `greet` that holds the string `"Hello World!"`. 

Solidity is a *statically typed* language, which means that you need to specify the type of the variable when you declare it. In this case `greet` is a `string`. We will look into different types later.

We also define the *visibility* of the variable, which specifies from where it can be accessed. In this case it's a `public` variable that can be accessed from inside and outside the contract. More on visibility later.

## ⭐️ Assignment
- Create a new public state variable called name with the value "Alice".
